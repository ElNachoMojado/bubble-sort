# bubble-sort
<h2>Problem</h2>
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).
<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use <strong>#each_with_index</strong> with two parameters: the index and the current value which was used as a temporary holder of that value to effectively do the switching.</li>
</ul>
